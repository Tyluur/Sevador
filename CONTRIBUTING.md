## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Tyluur/sevador-666/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Tyluur/sevador-666/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](https://github.com/Tyluur/sevador-666/issues)**.
- **Perform a cursory search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, **include as many details as possible**. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

### Pull Requests

- **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`.
- **Ensure the test suite passes** by running the appropriate test commands.
- **Write or adapt tests as needed**.
- **Follow the code style** used in the project.
- **Include appropriate documentation** where necessary.
- **Create a pull request**. The core team will review your change and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
